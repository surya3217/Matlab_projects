=> I made my assignment on "IP Calculator" in Matlab software.
   So, here is the instruction to open and run the program :-
 
 1) First, I created a folder named "IP_CALC",which contain all files.   

 2) Main program file  : "IP_calc.m"
    
 3) I have created six function for this program. They are in the folder separately
    because function create outside of the main program in matlab.
     
   # Functions which are using in this program are following : 
	1) calculation(ip,cust_sub,def_sub)  : function for calculation of all parameters		
	2) StringToNumber(m,n)     	     : to converting string array into a integer array   
	3) CustomSubnet(def_sub)   	     : to find the Custom subnet of given address 	
	4) SubnetRange(q)	   	     : to display the subnet range address
	5) Decimal2binary(bit1)    	     : to convert Decimal array into the binary array
	6) nthSubnet(z,h,p,u)	   	     : to find the nth subnet address for given number of subnet and host
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4) When you run the file the output will store in " .txt" file, where you can see the output for analysis.
    This file is also in "IP_CALC" folder.I have given the path of text file in main program.For new system you have to give path of file,
    where you want to store the file. 	   

 5) Sources of IP calculator :
	a) ip_addressing_and_subnetting_workbook
	b) ipcalc_examples

 6) How to run the file ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Firstly open the "IP_calc.m" file from the "IP_CALC" folder in the Matlab Software.

b) To run this file, press the RUN button which is in green arrow, at the top the "Editor Window". 

c) Then, output will come onto the "Command Window" ,at the bottom of the "Editor Window"

d) Do double click at the top of the "Command Window" for opening the output in full screen.

d) Now IP calculator is ready to work. Follow the instructions which will be asked by the program.

e) After that by giving input,You will get the desire output.
